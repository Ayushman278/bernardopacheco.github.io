# About Me

I'm Bernardo Pacheco. I live in Los Angeles, CA with my wife. I have a Master’s degree (MSc) in Software Engineering from COPPE/UFRJ ([Federal University of Rio de Janeiro][1]) and I also have a Bachelor’s degree (BS) from the same university (UFRJ).

I consider myself a seasoned software engineer with years of experience in Javascript/Typescript, Node.js and Web architecture. I have a particular interest in the human side of how people interact and use applications I create. It has to be easy, simple and as fast as possible.

I'm a team player who likes to collaborate and share knowledge to solve problems and achieve goals.
