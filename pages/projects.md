## bernardopacheco.net (this blog!)

My personal blog. I decided to build my own blog from scratch mainly because I wanted to fully integrate with GitHub, learn Jekyll and apply the best design practices. Another goal was to provide the community with a very easy blog to use and extend.

- Open source: <a href="https://github.com/bernardopacheco/bernardopacheco.github.io" target="_blank">get the source code on GitHub</a>
- Developed with Jekyll, GitHub Pages, ES5, Less and Material Design
- Easy to fork, use and extend
